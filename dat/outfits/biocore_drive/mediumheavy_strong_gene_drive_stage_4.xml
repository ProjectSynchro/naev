  <description>The gene drive is a Soromid bioship's equivalent to engines in synthetic ships. It is charged with moving the organism through space and comes in either a strong form (for heavy loads) or a fast form (for greater speed and agility). All gene drives start off undeveloped, but over time, just like the ships themselves, they grow and improve.</description>
