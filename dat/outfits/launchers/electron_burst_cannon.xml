  <description>This powerful energy weapon is built to bombard a target from great range with ion bursts, causing debilitating damage to a target's shields and electrical systems, which can leave a ship effectively defenseless. It was developed by the Za'lek to be used by their heavier droness to supplement the short range and high damage of their beams.</description>
