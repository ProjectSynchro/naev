My employers want to congratulate you about how effective you have been with Lord Battleaddict. I am afraid there won't be many people to mourn him." You answer that you don't know what this is about, and that as far as you know, Lord Battleaddict has been killed in an honest duel by the General Klank. The interlocutor laughs "You're playing your part, eh? I can understand you, after all, they pay you well... Wait, no, they don't pay well. Not at all! How much was it for risking your life twice with this EMP bomb trick? %s? Haw haw haw! You can make better money with a cargo mission!
   "I've even heard that once, they paid you with gauss guns! Those guys are so pitiful, aren't they?
   "Now, let's talk seriously: you want money and I want a pilot. We're made to get along, you and me! I need you for a special task. I won't deny it implies going against the interests of General Klank and Major Tam and co, but if you do it well, they won't ever know that you are implicated, and you'll receive %s in the process. Oh yes, that's different from what you're used to! What do you say?"]])

You remained loyal to our general, in spite of the absurdly high reward they had proposed to you for betraying us."]])
loyal_text2 = _([["Money matters are secondary matters, pilot. One day you are rich, and the next, you are poor. Valor, on the other hand, is the central matter of life for valor contains all the other qualities a Dvaered must have:
   "Righteousness to understand what has to be done,
   "Loyalty to know who you can trust to help you in your duty,
   "Strength to be able to do what Righteousness and Loyalty require you to do.
   "This demanding morale may require the Dvaered to risk their own lives or to kill for the community, because the philosophy of House Dvaered is a philosophy of life. And life does not come without its counterpart, death. Being a Dvaered means to accept the ultimate rule of the universe, the finitude of all things, unlike all the other factions, who hopelessly pursue eternity. Eternity in the succession of Emperors, eternity in faith, eternity in the progress of biological enhanced humanity. Their quest is doomed to fail, creating weird and ugly monsters like the Empire, House Sirius or the Soromid."]])
loyal_text3 = _([["House Dvaered has been built in respect of this ethic of life and death, that is taught to all children around all worlds in Dvaered space. You did not receive such an education and still, you passed the loyalty test. This means that Dvaered High Command can trust you. As a proof of this trust, I can reveal you what some among the army know, but was never revealed to non-Dvaered.
   "For one cycle now, the warlords have been greedily watching the Frontier planets. Since the FLF has been destroyed, Dvaered High Command does everything in its power to hold them back because we know that many other factions are waiting for us to get entangled in a war in the frontier in order to hit us. But the purpose of warlords is to invade worlds, and the role of the DHC is not to hinder that, so ultimately, we will have to allow this invasion.
   "A few decaperiods ago, General Klank had been promoted as second class general, with the task to organize this invasion. The first invasion plan that had been proposed to him was giving free rein to each warlord, allowing them to choose which planet to invade and how to proceed. However, contrary to the other generals, Klank soon realized that such a disorganized invasion, with inevitable battles between warlords, would take several periods, with a huge risk of ending up bogged down and vulnerable to attacks on other fronts."]])
loyal_text4 = _([["This is why the General Klank proposed an effective invasion plan, that requires coordinating the efforts of all the warlords, as well as supporting them with a reserve fleet directly commanded by DHC. The problem is that many warlords don't want the DHC to decide how they use their troops. The most reckless of them was Lord Battleaddict, but there are also Lady Bitterfight and Lord Jim. Now that the internal opposition to the plan has been weakened with Battleaddict's death, we will move to the diplomatic step. That is why you should expect to be summoned again by us."]])

With regards to how well you have helped us in the past, we will exceptionally let you live, but don't expect us to trust you anymore!"]])
