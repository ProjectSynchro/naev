-- Dvaered Meeting
-- This is the 5th mission of the Frontier War Dvaered campaign.
-- The player has to secure a Dvaered Warlord Meeting.
-- Hamelsen lures out the player, while Strafer gets killed by a spy who runs away.
-- There are two parts in the mission : part 1 is mainly contemplative, and part 2 is tricky, with fights and so.

   Stages :
   0) Way to Dvaer Prime
   1) Briefing at Dvaer Prime and patrol around DHC
   2) Following Hamelsen towards Laars (main purpose of this is to let the player save the game because second part is tricky)
   3) Taking off from Laars
   4) Land on Laars and get rewarded

Those squadrons are the 'Beta-Storks' and the 'Beta-Hammer' and their missions will be to control medium and heavy ships and to provide anti-heavy firepower in case of need. Our squadron, named 'Alpha-NightClaws', is in charge of fast ships (Yachts and Fighters). We will be flying Hyenas.
   "The procedure is the following: any ship approaching the station will be assigned to a squad by the fleet leader, and then to a pilot by the squad leader (Captain Leblanc). When a ship is attributed to you, you will have to approach the ship within 1000 m. Their security clearance code will be automatically requested and processed by the system we install right now on your core unit. Afterwards, the ship will be allowed to land, or ordered to fly away. The same thing happens for ships that leave the station.
   "Finally, in case something unexpected happens, you will of course have to obey to orders. Watch your messages closely. A few pilots will be kept in reserve close to the station.
   "Oh, and there is another point I must warn you about: it's the warlord's humour. When they see a small ship close to their Goddard, they may get the idea to shoot a small railgun-volley in your direction. Some of them tend to enjoy seeing pilots dodge for their lives. Dvaered laws authorize warlords to do so provided they can assure the High Command that there was no hostile intention. That can be a bit annoying, sometimes."]])

   "Watch out, citizen: this kind of question leads to compassion. Compassion leads to weakness and weakness leads to death. Death for yourself and for those who trusted you. Death for your leaders and for your subordinates. Death for people you love and people you respect. Remember: if you want to be strong, don't listen to compassion. Don't even give compassion any chance to reach your heart."]])

One just has to have received the '9th grade commendation', and to conquer a planet (or a station). In the army, every rank gives you a commendation grade, for example, I have the 3rd grade. Civilians also obtain commendation for their high deeds; you obtained the first grade commendation for your involvement in the FLF destruction, if I am right. The 9th grade commendation, that is associated to the rank of first class General in the army, gives the right to own a military base, and by extension, to be granted the regal power over a region.
   "In the Dvaered army, everybody starts as a raw soldier, no matter if you're an infantryman, a pilot, a medic or even a General's child. And only Valor decides how quick you rise in the hierarchy. Warlord is the ultimate rank for the military (and private combat pilots, like yourself)"]])

I dedicated my entire life to the greatness of House Dvaered, I practiced and sharpened all my skills to serve the Army at best. When I got recruited by Lord Battleaddict, I became faithful to him because he was giving me the opportunity to serve House Dvaered through him. And then...

Tell me when I have given up Valor! Tell me when I have given up Righteousness! Never! The Dvaered social contract is broken as far as I am concerned.

For 13 years, the only part of the universe I used to know was my village on Nanek, and the only people I used to know were its inhabitants. And now, I've seen hundreds of planets, and thousands of people all around the galaxy.
