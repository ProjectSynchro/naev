You know, foreigners sometimes think that the internecine conflicts between warlords are pointless (I've even heard the word "stupid" once), but actually, they're the key to Dvaered philosophy. Without those wars, the Dvaered Nation would no longer exist as we know it, and we would have had to rely on totalitarianism, like the Empire, nostalgia of an idealized past, like the Frontier, oppressive technocracy like the Za'lek, or such...
