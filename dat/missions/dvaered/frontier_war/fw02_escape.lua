Tam would explain it much better than I, but as Goddard is right in between our space and imperial space, they really have much to lose in case of a direct conflict. What is more, as we are House Goddard's best customer, they tend to appreciate us. (For example, we recently paid 6M credits to repair all the electronics of Klank and Battleaddict's Goddards).
   However, not all members of Goddard's executive board share the same view of our Frontier invasion projects. Mr. Danftang, their Public Relations Manager, in particular, used to see it as an opportunity to sell more cruisers to the High Command and was very favourable to the invasion. This man has been arrested recently by the Za'lek police for unclear reasons and many suspect this is linked to a score-settling scheme by Goddard shareholders.

   "Major Tam has prepared the operation. First, you will pick up Hamfresser and his team on %s in %s. I'll be there too and then we will fly in formation to %s and set up the ambush. It would be preferable if you would make sure that your ship doesn't outrun my Vendetta. There should be a few drones and a corvette. We will destroy the drones and disable the corvette, in order to let the commando unit enter the ship and recover the target. Tam has insisted that he doesn't want us to kill anybody as it could irritate the Za'lek a bit too much. After that, we will have to jump out of the system and to return to %s separately.
  "A fake transponder will be implemented on both our ships.

Then, he arrives at the point where the turtle was when he reached the previous point, but the turtle has again moved forward. And so on. Conclusion: Major Tam is quicker than the turtle, but he never catches up. How is that possible?"
   Strafer then arrives: "Yep, I've been to the museum of Theras one day, and this riddle was written on a book from before the space age.

We need her to lead the squadron, and she sent me instead. Do not worry, I might be slightly less gifted than her, but I am still a dogfight ace. I have got 15 attested dogfight victories so far, you know, and that does not take into account the secret operations I have taken part in.
   "So on the way in, I will follow you with my civilian Vendetta, and you will just have to hail me if you want me to do anything special.

Before long, the team comes back. Nikolov enters first, carrying an immobile and blue man in a prisoner suit, then Hamfresser, followed by the medic Therus, busily applying compresses on a large bloody wound on the captain's side, and by Tronk, who seems to be trying to explain himself.

After we destroyed the androids, and got to the imprisonment room, we saw that there were three other prisoners along with the target, and much more human guards than expected. They exploded our first assault bot, and we had to take them down with the paralyzers, but one of the prisoners took a weapon for some reason and started to fire on us. Fortunately for me, he just breached my lung. That is a replaceable part.
   "Then, Tronk paralyzed all the prisoners and we identified and recovered the target. That's why the guy is blue actually. But in his hurry, Tronk used the armor-piercing dose. According to the medic, it is worse that we first thought. Apparently, she can keep the guy alive for a few periods, but she needs a machine that is not on board to save him. So at next stop, I'm afraid we will have to steal the machine at the spaceport's hospital. It really annoys me as it's the kind of operation that can get ugly very quickly, especially since the killing interdiction still runs, but we have no choice. I'll just be waiting for your signal at the bar next time we land.

After a while, you see the commandos running in your direction, pursued by Za'lek police androids. When the last member of the team enters the ship, you take off in a hurry, closely followed by a few drones. "We made a mess, out there!" Says Hamfresser "But at least we've got the machine!"]])

die_title = _("Journey to the other side")
die_text = _([[After having outrun your enemies, you start inquiring about how the operation went at the hospital. A quick look at your living quarters gives you an answer. You see the VIP, still unconscious, but not blue anymore, his body covered by electrodes connected to the machine in question. Next to him, the commandos look like they had better days. Hamfresser, his face as pale as death, sits on the ground, leaning on a pillar, busy changing a long and blood-dripping bandage on his left arm. The sergeant Nikolov looks at a huge hole in her foot with an empty eye and the medic Therus limps from the one to the other, spreading blood marks on the walls.
   Lying in the center of the room, covered with bandages, is private Tronk. His battle armor, pierced with multiple holes, has been thrown a few meters away in a blood puddle. The soldier looks at the two remaining fingers of his less damaged arm that are slowly walking on the ground, in a sad smile. "Leopold, you remember when you were a kid? Did you play with your fingers like that?" Hamfresser answers: "Tronky-boy, don't use my first name, only dying people have used my first name before..." "Don't be afraid, this won't change, Leopold."
   Suddenly, the soldier opens his eyes wide and calls the medic: "Therus! I know why Major Tam can catch the turtle! Each time, when he reaches the point where the turtle previously was, the time he needs for that is smaller. And at some point, it becomes so infinitely small that even if you have an infinity of steps to go, the total time is finite." The medic looks at the dying man: "Tronky, how did you? Tronky?" She then stops and takes the pulse at Tronk's neck "It's over, captain." Hamfresser answers: "Damn! It's the fifth kid to die under my command and it still hurts as much. I just can't get used to that."]])

You wonder how this pilot could know so much about your operation, but the spiel continues: "Hewhewhew! People usually think I'm some useless pirates scum. I know you thought about that! Neh, don't lie to me!"
   The pilot's voice suddenly becomes harsh: "In reality, I am a faithful subject of his Imperial Majesty, as you should be yourself, %s from Hakoi! But you denied your own nation, and for that you should be severely punished. Don't forget, %s: The Empire is watching you. Anywhere. Anytime. Anyhow.

Give me 10 hecotseconds on the spacedock alone with him, not more, and the commander of the fleet in Alteris will forget to scan your ship when you'll jump to Goddard."
   That is for sure an uncommon request. You think at all the state secrets a wounded Hamfresser is able to give to the Empire in 10 hectoseconds.

After removing his uniform jacket (where his name and rank are written), Hamfresser takes a deep breath and joins the imperial agent outside, in front of the ship. From a window, you see them having what looks like a peaceful conversation.
   After a while, Hamfresser returns in the ship and the agent waves to indicate that you're allowed to take off. Nikolov ask her captain: "And?" "Who knows what these imperial weirdos wanted to know? I tried to dodge all the questions, but well. You never know."]])

You probably already got a fake transponder, but they seem to have identified it, so what about receiving another one? I can sell you an authentic fake transponder, coming straight outta Skulls and Bones factory."
   This person is for sure a pirate who wants to take the opportunity to get a few credits. The idea is not bad as the imperial ships would not look for a ship with a Skulls and Bones fake transponder. So you ask him how many credits he wants. "%s" is the answer. "That sounds a great many, doesn't it? But maybe it's a suitable amount of money for your life and the success of whatever unscrupulous mission you're trying to carry out.

   The executive moans and shakes his head "You Dvaered are silly! Do you think that violence is the solution to any problem?" Hamfresser seems surprised "Is there any other way to solve a problem?" The VIP then looks at you: "Hey, you seem a bit less fussy than the others... You're not a Dvaered, right? You know what? My grandma was always saying that the worst in the universe were the Dvaered and the Za'lek. And she was right. First the Za'lek imprisoned me under charge of 'scientific embezzlement' for alien motives, and now, you Dvaered shred your way to my cell and kidnap me."

No, strong-arm, learn that patience, negotiation, bribing and craftiness can achieve much more than violence and destruction.
