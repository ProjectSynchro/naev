   "Let me explain the context to you: I am currently in the middle of a secret diplomatic campaign with the Imperials, House Goddard and the Sirii. But there is a group of assassins who are constantly attacking me when I am moving. This is very annoying and we have already lost two pilots of Leblanc's squadron in these ambushes, including the second in command. The problem is that the ambushers use a mix of fighters, supported by medium ships. They even have a Kestrel!

No doubt the assassins will set up an ambush somewhere on the way. You and a few pilots from the Special Operations Force (SOF) will locate them and wait for me to jump in. During the ambush, the assassins will be caught in the crossfire, and we will annihilate them to the last ship. Actually, that sounds much more attractive than a 3 periods long meeting with rogue Sirian diplomats, doesn't it?
   "On our side, we will not have much firepower, so I count on you to provide with the armor and the guns (but you should still be able to outrun mid-range destroyers). You will team up with Lieutenant Strafer, because it worked well last time, and two other pilots. But the SOF does not have countless pilots, so the amount of your reward will depend on how many of them come back. Strafer will fly a scout with high performance sensors. He will be our eyes, so his death would mean the end of the mission.

The only one I'm worrying about is the Colonel Hamelsen: it will be very difficult for her to find a position with a warlord as they prefer to have people they know at higher ranks, and the DHC only rarely recruits new colonels.

An attested victory is recorded when you destroy alone any kind of enemy warship. As we tend to work in squads, we pretty often destroy ships without scoring any victory. My first one was a pirate hyena. The pilot was probably drunk or so and they headed right towards my Vendetta, broadcasting stupid taunts in the radio. My sergeant has been nice and did let the hyena to me. My second victory was against a freak... I mean a local warlord's pilot who claimed she could kill any DHC pilot in fair fight.
