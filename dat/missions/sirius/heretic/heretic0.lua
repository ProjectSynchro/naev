    He continues impatiently. "You look like you're in need of a couple spare credits," he finally says. "I have, uh, a shipment that needs getting to %s. Are you interested? Just has to be kept under wraps if you know what I mean. Pay is good though. %s. That's all you need to know." He pauses for a moment. "How about it?"]])
bmsg[2] = _([[You feel a very large hand slap you on the back. "I knew you would do it! A great choice!" he says. "I'll have my boys load up the cargo. Remember, all you gotta do is fly to %s, and avoid the Sirius military. You know, don't let them scan you. I'll let my contacts know to expect you. They'll pay you when you land."
    You shake his sticky hand and walk off, content that you've made an easy buck.]])

Finally, after a search that seem to take cycles, you see a small group of gruff and wary men waiting for you. Once you find them, they quickly unload the goods and disappear before you can even react.
    You then notice that one person, a large, unshaven man, remains from the group. You ask him for your payment. "Yes, yes, of course," he says as he hands you a credit chip. "Actually... if you're interested, we may have another mission for you. A message, as it were. The commander will be in the bar if you'd like to learn more about this opportunity." With that, he retreats along with the rest of the group. You wonder if you should pursue the offer or ignore it.]])
