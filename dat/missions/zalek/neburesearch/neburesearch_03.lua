    "Ah, right. There is a conference on %s in the %s system soon. Actually she is supposed to be the substitution for professor Voges. He is absent for weeks by now. No one knows what he is doing on Ruadan. Anyway, back to topic. You have to bring me there as ersatz-substitution for Dr. Mensing as she got seriously ill. But you already know that as you brought her here."
    You tell him that she looked perfectly fine and said she wants to conduct her research instead of going to the conference.
    "WHAT?? It was MY idea, initially! She just wants to kick me out! I bet she thinks she could just pull it off entirely without me to be the only author! No way she could ever achieve that!"
    "%s, you have to go to the conference instead! What do you mean you don't know anything about science? How about this, I just give you my presentation and while you're on the way I type the exact text I'd recite during my talk and send it to you. Just recite it on my behalf and it's going to be fine!"]])

    He stands up and searches his pockets for something. "Here, the presentation," he says and hands you a small data chip. He further adds, "And don't be too late!" before rushing out of the bar in a hurry. Wait a minute, you haven't agreed to accept the mission!]])

    Your thoughts are interrupted by an incoming message from the student. "As promised I'm sending you the text you have to recite. I hope you appreciate the time I wasted on typing that down. I hadn't considered that you'll have to answer questions after the talk, though. Do what every good scientist does and just talk about some random stuff that sounds like it may be related to the question. I'm sure you'll do it just fine. Good luck!"

There are distinct sections for casual and working lab coats. Whatever the difference is, it is too subtle for you to grasp. You settle on a "business" lab coat because something formal is probably suitable for your talk. The price tag reads %s. %s]])
