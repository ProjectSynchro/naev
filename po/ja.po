"effort performing the basic operations of the ship, causing your perception "
"of time to speed up. Time Dilation is simply a measure of how fast you will "

"a Time Dilation rating of 200%% means that time appears to pass twice as "
"fast as typical small ships.\n"
"    \"This, and the slower speed of your ship, may make it difficult to use "
"forward-facing weapons as well as on smaller ships. For the largest classes "
"- Destroyers and up - I would generally recommend use of turreted weapons, "
"which will automatically aim at your opponent, rather than forward-facing "
"weapons. That's of course up to you, though.\n"

"    Of course, please note that this is an incomplete game. You will "
"encounter dead ends to storylines, missing storylines, and possibly even "
"some bugs, although we try to keep those to a minimum of course. So be "
"prepared for some rough edges for the time being. That said, we are working "
"on this game every day and hope to one day finish this massive project on "
"our hands. Perhaps you could become one of us, who knows?\n"
"    For more information about the game and its development state, take a "
"look at naev.org; it has all the relevant links. And again, thank you for "
