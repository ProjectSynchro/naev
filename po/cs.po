"The night sky always draws our eyes. People look up with a question, or in "
"wonder, and sometimes with a dream: to venture forth among the stars."
msgstr ""
"Noční obloha vždy přitahuje naše oči. Lidé k ní vzhlížejí s otázkou nebo s "
"údivem a někdy i se snem: vydat se mezi hvězdy."

msgid ""
"From Earth, the first space-farers spied tiny jewels shining with the light "
"of distant suns, far away but so clear. To reach out and grasp one would "
"only cost a lifetime. Cheap at the price."
msgstr ""
"Ze Země první pozorovatelé vesmíru sledovali drobné drahokamy zářící světlem "
"vzdálených sluncí, daleko, ale tak jasně. Natáhnout ruku a uchopit ji by "

"So men and women locked their sleeping bodies into hulking metal boxes. They "
"hurled themselves out into the void. On arrival, they decanted and woke to "
"find new stars staring coldly down from stranger skies."
msgstr ""
"Muži a ženy tedy uzamkli spící těla do mohutných kovových krabic a vrhli se "
"do prázdna. Když se po příletu probudili, nalezli nové hvězdy, jak chladně "
"shlíží z cizí oblohy."

#: dat/intro:10
msgid ""
"The first wave of explorers crept from star to star at sublight speeds, "
"until the invention of the hyperspace drive spurred a second growth. Then "
"civilisation spread, as it always has, with exponential enthusiasm -- "
"ripples in the dark sea of space."
msgstr ""
"První vlna průzkumníků se plazila od hvězdy k hvězdě podprahovými "
"rychlostmi, až vynález hyperprostorového pohonu urychlil druhý rozmach. Poté "
"se civilizace rozšířila, jako vždy, s exponenciálním nadšením - vlnky v "
"temném moři vesmíru."

#: dat/intro:12
msgid ""
"However, the heroic age of discovery lasted only as long as human curiosity "
"outpaced greed. Too soon, conflict erupted on the colonies. Land, fuel, "
"food, and distrust sowed the seeds of discord. Once begun, the fever of war "
"spread from world to world and became a holocaust."
msgstr ""
"Hrdinský věk objevů však trval jen tak dlouho, dokud lidská zvědavost "
"předstihla chamtivost. Na koloniích příliš brzy vypukl konflikt. Půda, "
"palivo, jídlo a nedůvěra zaseli semeno sváru. Jakmile začala válečná "
"horečka, rozšířila se ze světa do světa a stala se holocaustem."

"After a hundred years of interstellar conflict, on the ashes that remained, "
"at last a new order built its foundations."
msgstr ""
"Po sto letech mezihvězdného konfliktu, na popelu, který zůstal, konečně nový "
"řád postavil své základy."

"A man named Daedris asserted dominion over the exhausted worlds. He founded "
"a Galactic Empire and named himself its ruler. Under the iron fist of his "
"military, relations between planets resumed; abandoned trade routes saw "
"traffic for the first time in living memory."
msgstr ""
"Muž jménem Daedris prosadil vládu nad vyčerpanými světy. Založil Galaktickou "
"říši a jmenoval se jejím vládcem. Pod železnou pěstí jeho armády se obnovily "
"vztahy mezi planetami; opuštěné obchodní cesty viděly provoz poprvé v živé "
"paměti."

#: dat/intro:19
msgid ""
"Scholars call it the zenith: technology leapt forward, culture flourished, "
"irradiated rock was cleansed and dead planets brought back to life. Peace "
"reigned in an imperial golden age."
msgstr ""
"Učenci tomu říkají zenit: technologie poskočila vpřed, kultura vzkvétala, "
"ozářená skála byla očištěna a mrtvé planety přivedeny zpět k životu. Mír "
"vládl v císařském zlatém věku."

#: dat/intro:21
msgid ""
"After Daedris, under his successors, the light of the empire waned. Civil "
"strife and religious division weakened social bonds. The great projects of "
"the imperium went awry. In some regions, administration fell into the hands "
"of other powers. The Great Houses now policed the space lanes."
msgstr ""
"Po Daedrisovi, pod jeho nástupci, světlo říše sláblo. Občanské spory a "
"náboženské rozdělení oslabily sociální vazby. Velké projekty imperia se "
"zhoršily. V některých regionech se správa dostala do rukou jiných mocností. "
"Velké domy nyní hlídaly vesmírné cesty."

#: dat/intro:29
msgid ""
"From Earth, a cataclysmic explosion ripped through space, annihilating "
"stars, vaporising worlds. Billions died. Dozens of systems disappeared into "
"the mysterious nebula left behind. Now the great, galaxy-spanning "
"civilisation survives as a shadow of its former glory."
msgstr ""
"Ze Země proběhla vesmírem kataklyzmatická exploze, ničící hvězdy, vypařující "
"světy. Miliardy zemřely. Desítky systémů zmizely v tajemné mlhovině po sobě "
"zanechané. Předtím velká civilizace rozkládající se po galaxiích nyní "
"přežívá jako stín své bývalé slávy."

"Ten Standard Cycles have passed in a universe ruled by the shards of a "

"where there is chaos, there is also opportunity."
msgstr ""
"Deset standardních cyklů uplynulo ve vesmíru ovládaném střepy rozpadající se "
"říše. Po incidentu je na denním pořádku korupce a pirátství, ale tam, kde je "

#. -- Dvaered Meeting
#. -- This is the 5th mission of the Frontier War Dvaered campaign.
#. -- The player has to secure a Dvaered Warlord Meeting.
#. -- Hamelsen lures out the player, while Strafer gets killed by a spy who runs away.
#. -- There are two parts in the mission : part 1 is mainly contemplative, and part 2 is tricky, with fights and so.
#.
#. Stages :
#. 0) Way to Dvaer Prime
#. 1) Briefing at Dvaer Prime and patrol around DHC
#. 2) Following Hamelsen towards Laars (main purpose of this is to let the player save the game because second part is tricky)
#. 3) Taking off from Laars
#. 4) Land on Laars and get rewarded
#. --
#. TODO: hooks to penalize attacking people
#. Equips a quick and strong Hyena
#. Remove all cargo (to make them lighter)
#. Hamelsen managed to land. That is badbadbad.
#. Landing on Laarss: indicate the player he has to follow her
#. Hamelsen is in range: do as usual
#. Player checks security clearance of Hamelsen: let the fun begin
#. hamelsen:rename( _("Suspect Hyena") )
#. First run away (for hellburner) then land
#. Let's rock a bit !
#. Hamelsen heads towards Laars
#. Discuss with an officer on Laarss
#. Add a spy close to Gremlin, make Strafer head to it, and a group of Hyenas kill Strafer to secure the spy's exit
#. Compute the line on which to place the spy and Strafer
#. First, teleport Strafer far away from any backup

"white blip representing your ship appears near the jump point. \"Your ship "
"will be equipped with an IFF transponder in use by the FLF, so to anyone who "
"isn't looking too closely you will appear as an FLF ship. Of course, this "
"alone is not enough. The FLF will assume you know where their base is, since "
"you look like one of them. It is important to note that the transponder will "
"work best in the Nebula, which we believe is where the base should be "
"located.\"\n"
"    The image on the wall updates again, this time showing several House "
"Dvaered crests near your ship.\n"
"    \"Some time after you enter the system, several of our military assets "
"will jump in and open fire. To the FLF, it will look like one of their own "

"While you finally jump out, Hamfresser reports: \"We've got an unexpected "
"situation in there. After we destroyed the androids, and got to the "
"imprisonment room, we saw that there were three other prisoners along with "
"the target, and much more human guards than expected. They exploded our "
"first assault bot, and we had to take them down with the paralyzers, but one "
"of the prisoners took a weapon for some reason and started to fire on us. "
"Fortunately for me, he just breached my lung. That is a replaceable part.\n"
"   \"Then, Tronk paralyzed all the prisoners and we identified and recovered "
"the target. That's why the guy is blue actually. But in his hurry, Tronk "
"used the armor-piercing dose. According to the medic, it is worse that we "
"first thought. Apparently, she can keep the guy alive for a few periods, but "
"she needs a machine that is not on board to save him. So at next stop, I'm "
"afraid we will have to steal the machine at the spaceport's hospital. It "
"really annoys me as it's the kind of operation that can get ugly very "
"quickly, especially since the killing interdiction still runs, but we have "
"no choice. I'll just be waiting for your signal at the bar next time we "
"land.\n"
"   \"If I may, I'd advise you to land somewhere within 3 periods, otherwise "

"outfitter so that you'll be able to prepare your ship at best in case we "

"from the Special Operations Force (SOF) will locate them and wait for me to "

"and we will annihilate them to the last ship. Actually, that sounds much "
"more attractive than a 3 periods long meeting with rogue Sirian diplomats, "
"doesn't it?\n"

#. Drinking Aristocrat
#. Author: geekt
#. Idea from todo list.
#.
#. An aristocrat wants a specific drink which he recalls from a certain planet and will pay handsomely if you bring it. When you get to said planet it turns out the drink isn't served there but the bartender gives you a hint. You are then hinted until you end up getting the drink and bringing it back.
#.
#. Thank you to Bobbens, Deiz, BTAxis, and others that have helped me with learning to use Lua and debugging my scripts in the IRC channel. Thanks as well to all those that have contributed to Naev and made it as great as it is today, and continue to make it better every day.

#. MISSION: Defend the System 1
#. DESCRIPTION: A mission to defend the system against swarm of pirate ships.
#. This will be the first in a planned series of random encounters.
#. After the third specifically scripted pirate invasion, a militia will form.
#. The player will have the option to join the militia.
#. Perhaps the random missions will eventually lead on to a plot line relating to the pirates.
#.
#. Notable events:
#.
#. * Stage one: From the bar, the player learns of a pirate fleet attacking the system and joins a defense force.
#. * Stage two: The volunteer force attacks the pirates.
#. * Stage three: When a sufficient number have been killed, the pirates retreat.
#. * Stage four: The portmaster welcomes the fleet back and thanks them with money.
#. * Stage five: In the bar afterward, another pilot wonders why the pirates behaved unusually.
#.
#. TO DO
#. Make comm chatter appear during the battle
#. Add some consequences if the player aborts the mission

#. When the raiders are on the run then the Empire takes over
#. Call ships to base
#. Get a position near the player for late Empire re-enforcements
#. The player lands to a warm welcome (if the job is done).
#. If any pirates still alive, send player back out.
#. A fellow warrior says hello in passing if player jumps out of the system without landing

#. -- The player pays a fellow pirate to know where to steal a random ship.
#.
#. The player pays to get the position of a ship on a random planet of a random
#. faction. When he gets there, the planet is guarded (which means he may have
#. to fight his way through, which is the most probable option).
#.
#. When he lands on the target planet, he gets a nice message explaining what
#. happens, he gets a new ship, is able to refit it, etc.
#.
#. Then, when the player wants to leave the planet, and that will eventually
#. happen (at least, I hope…) he’ll be pursued by a few fighters.

#. Mission: The one with the Runaway
#. Description: A prototype drone runs away and needs to be caught by the player
#. How to make this more interesting than just go to a system and shoot down the drone w ion or medusa? The ship has to have enough cargo for the drone to be transported back.
#. So the player has to hail the drone bc the scientist wants to patch the software which fails and the drone causes other drones to attack.
#. I was thinking of player having to use electronic warfare. But is there a way to check that?
#. Difficulty: relatively easy?

#. Rescue script for stranded pilots.
#.
#. The basic structure is as follows:
#.
#. If the player lacks any core outfits, either:
#.
#. a) The ship's defaults are added to the empty slots
#. b) All cores are replaced with the ship's defaults
#.
#. If that fails, then the player is presented with various options:
#.
#. a) Remove all non-cores
#. b) Remove weapons, utility, or structure outfits separately
#. b) Replace cores with defaults
#.
#. There is no failure mode beyond this, as a ship that isn't spaceworthy
#. in its default state already generates warnings on load.
#.
#. This script has two known flaws at the moment. Players aren't considered
#. stranded if the outfitter sells outfits that can fill all missing slots,
#. or replace existing cores. This is done without regard to affordability.
#.
#. The second is that some conditions (e.g. free cargo space) are independent
#. of outfits, and because we don't explicitly check them, fall-through to the
#. final "this is a bug, please report" happens more than it ought to.
#.

#. If the player isn't missing any core outfits, and has non-core outfits
#. equipped, we let them resolve the issue manually.

#. The last simple case is: If the planet has a shipyard that sells ships the
#. player can afford, the player is not considered stranded.
#.
#. From there, it gets decidedly more complex. An outfit pool is created,
#. consisting of the player's inventory, plus:
#.
#. a) If the planet has a shipyard, the player's other ships' outfits
#. b) If the planet has an outfitter, the outfitter's stock
#.
#. At this point, the player is only stranded under two circumstances:
#.
#. 1) They're missing core outfits and nothing in the pool fits.
#. 2) The ship is bare aside from core outfits, yet isn't spaceworthy
#. and no other suitable core outfits are available.

"Welcome to Naev version %s, and thank you for playing! We hope you enjoy "
"this game and all it has to offer. This is a passion project developed "
"exclusively by volunteers and it gives us all great joy to know that there "
"are others who love this game as much as we do!\n"
"    Of course, please note that this is an incomplete game. You will "
"encounter dead ends to storylines, missing storylines, and possibly even "
"some bugs, although we try to keep those to a minimum of course. So be "
"prepared for some rough edges for the time being. That said, we are working "
"on this game every day and hope to one day finish this massive project on "
"our hands. Perhaps you could become one of us, who knows?\n"
"    For more information about the game and its development state, take a "
"look at naev.org; it has all the relevant links. And again, thank you for "
