   This is a Naev mission template.
   In this document aims to provide a structure on which to build many
   Naev missions and teach how to make basic missions in Naev.
   For more information on Naev, please visit: http://naev.org/
   Naev missions are written in the Lua programming language: http://www.lua.org/
   There is documentation on Naev's Lua API at: http://api.naev.org/
   You can study the source code of missions in [path_to_Naev_folder]/dat/missions/

   When creating a mission with this template, please erase the
   explanatory comments (such as this one) along the way, but retain the
   above license header and the MISSION and DESCRIPTION fields below,
   adapted to your mission.

   MISSION: <NAME GOES HERE>
   DESCRIPTION: <DESCRIPTION GOES HERE>

--]]

-- require statements go here. Most missions should include
-- numstring.lua, which provides the useful `numstring()` and
-- `creditstring()` functions. We use these functions to format numbers
-- as text properly in Naev. dat/missions/neutral/common.lua provides
-- the addMiscLog function, which is typically used for non-factional
-- unique missions.
require "numstring.lua"
require "missions/neutral/common.lua"

--[[
Multi-paragraph dialog strings should go here, each with an identifiable
name. You can see here that we wrap strings that are displayed to the
player with `_()`. This is a call to gettext, which enables
localization. The _() call should be used directly on the string, as
shown here, instead of on a variable, so that the script which figures
out what all the translatable text is can find it.

When writing dialog, write it like a book (in the present-tense), with
paragraphs and quotations and all that good stuff. Leave the first
paragraph unindented, and indent every subsequent paragraph by four (4)
spaces. Use quotation marks as would be standard in a book. However, do
*not* quote the player speaking; instead, paraphrase what the player
generally says, as shown below.

In most cases, you should use double-brackets for your multi-paragraph
dialog strings, as shown below.

One thing to keep in mind: the player can be any gender, so keep all
references to the player gender-neutral. If you need to use a
third-person pronoun for the player, singular "they" is the best choice.

You may notice instances of "%s" sprinkled throughout the text. These
are portions that will be filled in later by the mission via the
`string.format()` function.
--]]
ask_text = _([[As you approach the guy, he looks up in curiosity. You sit down and ask him how his day is. "Why, fine," he answers. "How are you?" You answer that you are fine as well and compliment him on his suit, which seems to make his eyes light up. "Why, thanks! It's my favorite suit! I had it custom tailored, you know.
    "Actually, that reminds me! There was a special suit on %s in the %s system, the last one I need to complete my collection, but I don't have a ship. You do have a ship, don't you? So I'll tell you what, give me a ride and I'll pay you %s for it! What do you say?"]])


--[[ 
First you need to *create* the mission.  This is *obligatory*.

You have to set the NPC and the description. These will show up at the
bar with the character that gives the mission and the character's
description.
--]]
function create ()
   -- Set our mission parameters.
   misplanet, missys = planet.get("Ulios")
   credits = 250000
   talked = false

   -- Here we use the `creditstring()` function to convert our credits
   -- from a number to a string. This function both applies gettext
   -- correctly for variable amounts (by using the ngettext function),
   -- and formats the number in a way that is appropriate for Naev (by
   -- using the numstring function). You should always use this when
   -- displaying a number of credits.
   reward_text = creditstring(credits)
   
   -- If we needed to claim a system, we would do that here with
   -- something like the following commented out statement. However,
   -- this mission won't be doing anything fancy with the system, so we
   -- won't make a system claim for it.
   --if not misn.claim(missys) then misn.finish(false) end

   -- Give the name of the NPC and the portrait used. You can see all
   -- available portraits in dat/gfx/portraits.
   misn.setNPC( _("A well-dressed man"), "neutral/unique/youngbusinessman.webp", _("This guy is wearing a nice suit.") )
end


--[[
This is an *obligatory* part which is run when the player approaches the
character.

Run misn.accept() here to internally "accept" the mission. This is
required; if you don't call misn.accept(), the mission is scrapped.
This is also where mission details are set.

function accept ()
   -- Use different text if we've already talked to him before than if
   -- this is our first time.
   local text
   if talked then
      -- We use `string.format()` here to fill in the destination and
      -- reward text. `s1:format(s2)` is a shorthand for
      -- `string.format(s1, s2)`.
      text = _([["Ah, it's you again! Have you changed your mind? Like I said, I just need transport to %s in the %s system, and I'll pay you %s when we get there. How's that sound?"]]):format( misplanet:name(), missys:name(), reward_text )

      -- This is where we would define any other variables we need, but
      -- we won't need any for this example.

      -- Hooks go here. We use hooks to cause something to happen in
      -- response to an event. In this case, we use a hook for when the
      -- player lands on a planet.

   if planet.cur() == misplanet then
      -- Mission accomplished! Now we do an outro dialog and reward the
